# Synthetic Data Generator 
  
This project is a data analysis and report generation tool that uses synthetic data to simulate real-world scenarios. By leveraging the power of Python, Jinja, and Streamlit, it allows users to conduct statistical tests, calculate key metrics, and create informative HTML reports.  
  
The value of this project lies in its ability to assist data scientists and analysts in their data exploration tasks, offering a streamlined way to generate synthetic data, analyze it, and visualize the results. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where real-world data is not available or limited.  
  
The project is designed with simplicity and flexibility in mind, making it easy to adjust according to specific data analysis needs.
